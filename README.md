### Step by step guide if you want to help us
1) Donate on one of the wallets if you want.
2) After donation (or without) you can generate a wallet for our blockchain.
3) Save all the information about generated wallet. It will be required in the future.
4) Create an issue on the GitHub (see below) for getting the reward in our native tokens.

### Generating unit address
Address can be generated on our website: [link](https://unitchain.org/generateWalletAddress). 
After you've made donations you should open issue for this repository (see how to open issue [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)) with the structure mentioned below.
